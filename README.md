## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

1. **Python 3.8 or higher**

   - Download from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
   - To verify installation, open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see something like "Python 3.8.x"

2. **pip (Python package installer)**

   - Usually comes with Python installation
   - To verify installation, type:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```

3. **Google API key for Gemini AI**
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy your API key (you'll need it later)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download the Program**

   - Click the green "Code" button on this page
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
   - Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Navigate to the extracted folder:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/vinted-desc-generator
     ```
   - Replace "path/to" with the actual path where you extracted the files

2. **Set Up Python Environment**

   - Create a virtual environment (this keeps the program's files separate from other Python programs):
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Mac/Linux:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
   - You'll know it's activated when you see `(.venv)` at the start of your command line

3. **Install Required Packages**

   - With the virtual environment activated, run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Wait for all packages to install (this might take a few minutes)

4. **Set Up API Key**

   - In the program folder, create a new file named `.env`
   - Open it with any text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit)
   - Add this line, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - Save the file
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never share your API key with anyone!

5. **Run the Program**
   - Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(.venv)` in your terminal)
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - You should see a message that the server is running
   - Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **"Python is not recognized" error**

   - Make sure Python is added to your PATH during installation
   - Try reinstalling Python and check "Add Python to PATH"

2. **"pip is not recognized" error**

   - Try using `python -m pip` instead of just `pip`

3. **"Module not found" errors**

   - Make sure you're in the virtual environment (you should see `(.venv)`)
   - Try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

4. **Program won't start**
   - Check if you're in the correct directory
   - Make sure the `.env` file is created with your API key
   - Try closing and reopening your terminal
